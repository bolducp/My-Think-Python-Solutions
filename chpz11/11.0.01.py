"""Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores
them as keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are.
Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a
string is in the dictionary.
If you did Exercise 11, you can compare the speed of this implementation
with the list in operator and the bisection search."""
