# My-Think-Python-Solutions 

These are my attempts at solutions to the exercises in Allen Downey's free online textbook, Think Python. 

They are organized by chapter. Each file is titled by the chapter number.section number.exercise number. So, for example, 6.04.03.py is my solution for Chapter 6, Section 4, Exercise number 3.

Starting with chapter 6, each file contains the exercise prompt as a comment at the beginning of the file.
